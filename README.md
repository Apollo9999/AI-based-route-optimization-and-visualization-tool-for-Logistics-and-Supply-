Problem Statement Defined as Every day, thousands of orders are placed with retailers and ecommerce companies which are delivered to consumers. These orders are delivered by hundreds of drivers who follow a prescribed route to honor the customers’ availability. At the same time, retailers strive to reduce cost by minimizing routes, trucks and drivers. However, the customer’s availability itself is very dynamic today. Customers today want flexibility- delivery at home/ office/ pickup etc. Can the platforms be capable of adjusting to customer preferences instead of the other way around?
